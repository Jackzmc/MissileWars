missiles:
#  #EXAMPLE:
#  examplemissile:
#    item: #the bukkit material type
#    schematic: (also optional) the schematic name, must exist for both teams like red-NAME and green-NAME
#    hint: optional text to add (ex lightning: fastest missile)
#  #NOTES:
#  schematic is just the name of the file without the team prefix, by default is the id (examplemissile)
#  which will look for a schematic file called 'green-examplemissile' or 'red-examplemissile'
#  if you do specify shcematic property, it will replace the id with that.
# #ALSO: each missile's item must be UNIQUE, or only the first entry will be used
